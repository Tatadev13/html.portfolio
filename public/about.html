<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I enjoy doing things on the computer. I love to draw and design things through the website. Since I was a child, 
  I enjoy doing things and exploring things on the internet. I enjoy the graphics that I see on the screen. </p>

<p>If I don't do something on the computer or doing projects, I enjoy doing things outdoor. I play tennis or pickleball
  with my daughter and sister. I travel when I can for short or long drive. Furthermore I, visit family and friends when 
  its possible that my work
  permit.
</p>

<p>I enjoy reading my Bible and get to know the God who made everything. All my blessings that I have comes from Him. 
  When I am at home I enjoy cooking my native food and dessert.
